# RUN
# two variations: 'r' plus single hex digit to represent number of additional copies to be included (up to 15)
# "R" with 2 hex digits that represent number of additional copies, being up to 255. Could span several rows.
# intialize to black

# COPY OF PREV
# color inserted to front of list of previous colours (initalize with black), IF NOT IN LIST ALREADY
# if length greater than 256, last color should be discarded to make room
# 'i' plus single hex, being the index into the list of prev colors
# 'I' two hex digits which ref the list of colors

# use while loop instead of for loop
# intitalize variables that represent x and y ahead of the loop
# body of loop increases the pixels 
# not sure how a run works because it may skip forward??

# if command line arg provided, that will be the name
# if no cmd line, read name with input function
# else, too many args provided and quit??

# use the tiny files first
# start with support for full RGB values
# then diff from prev pixel
# then run of identical pixels
# then list of prev pixels

# always output to output.okti
# websites or fc command can be used to check difference in files
