Requirements for the Café Wall Illusion:
 Resize the window so that it is 800 pixels by 598 pixels by calling the resize function.
 Clear the window so that any previous illusion is removed.
 The illusion includes 13 rows, each of which consists of alternating black and white
squares.
 Each black and white square is 44 pixels by 44 pixels. The gray lines separating the squares
are all 2 pixels wide, as are the gray lines that separate adjacent rows.
 In the first, fifth, nineth and thirteenth rows, the white square that begins the row is aligned
with the left edge of the window.
 In the even numbered rows, the first white square in the row is 27 pixels from the left edge of
the window.
 In the third, seventh and eleventh rows, the first white square is 42 pixels from the left edge
of the window. 

*Question: Is it intentional that in the example photo, the left and bottom lines are cut off?
